Dear Nicholas, things are much clearer now, and I realize the danger you are in. I was visited today by two gentlemen matching the description of Valentine and Proteus. They claimed to be acting for the government and were asking if I knew where to find you. They clearly were aware that you had left Malta, but fortunately had not, as far as I can tell, traced you here. 
They were most insistent that they needed to talk with you, saying that the government was owed a substantial sum from the estate of your Uncle and that they wished to discuss terms for repayment. I have to say that I was impressed by their ingenuity. They might equally have claimed to be offering you a sum owed to Tiberius, but the tale they spun carried just the right level of threat to be (almost) convincing.
I deciphered the latest chapter of your Uncleâ€™s will with little more difficulty than I had encountered with the previous section. It was very similar in spirit, and indeed used the same tabula recta, though the encryption algorithm was slightly different. I believe it is known as the Beaufort cipher. 
I recommend that you stay away from London for a little while, until we have considered what we must do to protect you. I have contacts who may be able to help.

Very best wishes, 

Charles
