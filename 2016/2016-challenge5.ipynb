      "harry it is hard to make sense of the latest message from martin what is the temp bank is it a network of part time spies jamelia implied that it washer coding skills that dynamix were interested in so i began to wonder if jamelia was working on a recruitment tool using social media but that sounds abit oldschool could she and martin have been developing a screening algorithm for agents trying to pick out the most reliable ones by datamining how would that have fitted with her real expertise in signal noise analysis surely the data isnt that noisy i did have some luck with background on the pds syndicate they were initially setup to deal with a future in which quantum transmission makes it impossible to crack ciphers using digital methods pds stands for post digital surveillance and they were an arms length cabinet office initiative kept completely separate from the other intelligence agencies i think the plan was total deniability on all sides and it was structured to prevent interagency rivalry the syndicate had prime ministerial signoff but after that there is no paper trail and there has been no news of any progress insiders think the syndicate was closed down in january after rumours of unauthorised surveillance but given that bulk collection in the uk is authorised it is hard to imagine what they were up to i know that several of the people who launched pds left the civil service in february and two now have board positions at citadelle to the best of my knowledge none of the seniors had direct contact with jamelia or martin but i suppose it is possible that citadelle was just the vehicle for pds to keep an eye on the two of them i still dont know why they were regarded as special though maybe trinity has something for us she sent the following message hidden in an image file in in stag rama sort of wish you were here things oi am guessing that she feels the need to be fairly discrete she has also increased the security level of her comms but unfortunately due to a mixup with housekeeping we we rentable to setup a secure channel for key exchange before trinity left to join the dynamix team fortunately she is good at improvising and she has taken a lead from martin and used a column transposition cipher that also explains the steganography trinity knows that the opposition will find it reasonably straightforward to crack if they spot it a word of warning trinity s cipher is tougher to crack than martins and i had to hunt a littlebit for the crib but maybe you will find it more easily knowing all this atleast she didnt resort to martins reversing trick so maybe we should consider ourselves lucky i dont want to push our luck to of a randi dont want to expose trinity to more risk than necessary when you reply i suggest we follow trinity s advice and use avi genere cipher a keyword of length three should be adequate best charlie\n"
