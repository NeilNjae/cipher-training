I AM GUESSING YOU STEAMED IT OFF AND FOUND IT THERE. IT WAS A PRETTY INGENIOUS PLOY. MY MASTERS BACK IN WASHINGTON ARE INCREASINGLY WORRIED ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REST OF THE FOUR POWERS. FOLLOWING THE BREAKDOWN IN TRUST WITH THE SOVIETS THEY ARE COUNTING ON THE UK AND FRANCE AS ALLIES. IF THEY ARE GOING BEHIND OUR BACKS WITH THIS REICHSDOKTOR, THAT DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR FUTURE DIPLOMACY. DO YOU HAVE CONTACTS THERE YOU CAN EXPLOIT TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE INTENDING? WE REALLY CANNOT AFFORD TO FALL OUT RIGHT NOW. THE ATTACHED MESSAGE IS ANOTHER INTERCEPT, THIS TIME FROM THE BRITISH EMBASSY WIRELESS. WHILE THINGS ARE DICEY I DONâ€™T FEEL I CAN ASK THEM ABOUT IT, MAYBE YOU COULD CRACK IT FOR US. DOES IT MENTION THE RATLINES? BEST, CHARLIE\n",
