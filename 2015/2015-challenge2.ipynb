      "CHARLIE, NO NEED TO APOLOGISE, LIFE WAS GETTING DULL BEHIND A DESK AND I WAS GLAD TO HAVE AN EXCUSE TO FLY BACK TO EUROPE. I AM INTRIGUED ABOUT THE REICHSDOKTOR - I HADN'T COME ACROSS THIS BEFORE, WHEN DID YOU FIRST COME HEAR OF IT? \n",

I DID NOTICE THAT THE LETTERS ON THE FRONT COULD BE HIGHLIGHTED TO PICK OUT THE PHRASE THE REICHSDOKTOR SO UNLESS THAT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCE I FIGURED IT MUST BE RELATED TO OUR INVESTIGATION. THE STRANGEST THING WAS THAT THE POSTCARD HAD A STAMP BUT NO POSTMARK ON IT, SO IT CAN'T HAVE BEEN POSTED. SINCE IT WASN'T SIGNED I ASSUME THEY WANTED TO STAY ANONYMOUS AND I COULDN'T SEE WHY THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE RISK OF HAND DELIVERING IT, BUT IN THE END I WORKED IT OUT. THERE WAS A HIDDEN MESSAGE. I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IT WAS HIDDEN. ANYWAY I'VE ATTACHED THE MESSAGE I FOUND. I KNOW THAT RELATIONS WITH THREE OF THE FOUR POWERS ARE RELATIVELY STABLE, BUT I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THIS TO OURSELVES FOR NOW. ALL THE BEST, \n",
